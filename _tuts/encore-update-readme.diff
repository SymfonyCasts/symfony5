+**Optional: Webpack Encore Assets**
+
+This app uses Webpack Encore for the CSS, JS and image files. But
+to keep life simple, the final, built assets are already inside the
+project. So... you don't need to do anything to get thing set up!
+
+If you *do* want to build the Webpack Encore assets manually, you
+totally can! Make sure you have [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)
+installed and then run:
+
+```
+yarn install
+yarn encore dev --watch
+```
+
