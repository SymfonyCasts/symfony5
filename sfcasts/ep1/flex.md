# Flex, Recipes & Aliases

We're going to install a *totally* new package into our app called the
"security checker". The security checker is a tool that looks at your
application's dependencies and tell you if any of them have known security
vulnerabilities. But, full disclosure, as *cool* as that is... the *real*
reason I want to install this library is because it's a *great* way to look at
Symfony's all-important "recipe" system.

At your terminal, run:

```terminal
composer require sec-checker --no-scripts
```

***TIP
You can still download the security checker to see how its recipe works,
but the API it uses has been discontinued in favor of other solutions.

In a real app, you *should* probably pass `--dev` to add this to your *dev*
dependencies... but it won't matter for us.

## Flex Aliases

There *is*, however, something weird here. Specifically... `sec-checker`
is *not* a valid package name! In the Composer world, *every* package *must* be
`something/something-else`: it can't just be `sec-checker`. So what the heck
is going on?

Back in PhpStorm, open up `composer.json`. When we started the project, we
had just a *few* dependencies in this file. One of them is `symfony/flex`.

[[[ code('4bf6b1df52') ]]]

This is a composer *plugin* that adds *two* special features to Composer itself.
The first is called "aliases".

At your browser, go to http://flex.symfony.com to find and big page full of packages.

***TIP
The flex.symfony.com server was shut down in favor of a new system. But you can still
see a list of all of the available recipes at https://bit.ly/flex-recipes!
***

Search for `security`. Better, search for `sec-checker`. Boom! This says that there
is a package called `sensiolabs/security-checker` and it has aliases of
`sec-check`, `sec-checker`, `security-checker` and some more.

The alias system is simple: because Symfony Flex is in our app, we can say
`composer require security-checker`, and it will *really* download
`sensiolabs/security-checker`.

You can see this in our terminal: we said `sec-checker`, but ultimately it
downloaded `sensiolabs/security-checker`. That's also what Composer added to our
`composer.json` file. So... aliases are just a nice shortcut feature... but
it's kinda cool! You can almost *guess* an alias when you want to install something.
Want a logger? Run `composer require logger` to get the recommended logger.
Need to mail something? `composer require mailer`. Need to eat a cake?
`composer require cake`!

## Flex Recipes

The *second* feature that Flex adds to Composer is the *really* important one.
It's the recipe system.

Back at the terminal, after installing the package, it said:

> Symfony operations: 1 recipe
> configuring sensiolabs/security-checker.

Interesting. Run:

```terminal
git status
```

Whoa! We expected `composer.json` and `composer.lock` to be modified... that's
how composer works. But something *also* modified a `symfony.lock` file... and
added a totally *new* `security_checker.yaml` file!

Ok, first, `symfony.lock` is a file that's managed by Flex. You don't need to
worry about it, but you *should* commit it. It keeps a big list of which recipes
have been installed.

So, who created the other file? Open it up: `config/packages/security_checker.yaml`.

[[[ code('ae0e8f67cb') ]]]

Each package you install *may* have a Flex "recipe". The idea is *beautifully*
simple. Instead of telling people to install a package and *then* create this file,
and update this other file in order to get things working, Flex executes a
*recipe* which... just does that stuff for you! This file was added by the
`sensiolabs/security-checker` recipe!

You don't need to worry about the specifics of what's *inside* this file right
now. The point is, *thanks* to this file, we have a new `bin/console` command.
Run:

```terminal
php bin/console
```

See that `security:check` command? That wasn't there a second ago. It's there
*now* thanks to the new YAML file. Try it:

```terminal
php bin/console security:check
```

No packages have known vulnerabilities! Awesome!

## How Recipes Work

Here is the *big* picture: thanks to the recipe system, whenever you install a
package, Flex will check to see if that package has a recipe and, if it does,
will install it. A recipe can do many things, like add files, create directories
or even *modify* a *few* files, like adding new lines to your `.gitignore` file.

The recipe system is a *game-changer*. I *love* it because anytime I need a
new package, all I need to do is install it. I don't need to add configuration
files or modify anything because the recipe automates all that boring work.

## Recipes can Modify Files

In fact, this recipe did something *else* we didn't notice. At the terminal, run:

```terminal
git diff composer.json
```

We expected that Composer would add this new line to the `require` section. But
there is *also* a new line under the `scripts` section. That was done by the
recipe.

[[[ code('28230b4aec') ]]]

Thanks to this, whenever you run `composer install` after it finishes, 
it automatically runs the security checker.

***TIP
Running `composer install` will fail with 403 API error. It's ok, we will 
remove security checker in the next chapter so it won't be an issue.

The point is: to use the security checker, the *only* thing we needed to do was...
install it. Its recipe took care of the rest of the setup.

Now... if you're wondering:

> Hey! Where the heck does this recipe live? Can I see it?

That's a *great* question! Let's find out where these recipes live and what they look like next.
