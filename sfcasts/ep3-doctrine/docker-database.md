# make:docker:database

Doctrine is installed! Woo! Now we need to make sure a database is running - like
MySQL or PostgreSQL - and then update the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
to point to it.

[[[ code('44307a5c42') ]]]

So: you can *absolutely* start a database manually: you can download MySQL or
PostgreSQL onto your machine and start it. *Or* you can use Docker, which is what
*we* will do. OooOoooo.

## Using Docker?

Now, hold on: if you're nervous about Docker... or you haven't used it much... or
you used it and hated it, stay with me! Using Docker *is* optional for
this tutorial, but we're going to use it in a very lightweight way.

The only requirement to get started is that you need to have Docker downloaded
and running on your machine. I already have Docker running on my machine for Mac.

Docker is *all* about creating tiny *containers* - like a container
that holds a MySQL instance and another that holds a PHP installation. Traditionally,
when *I* think of Docker, I think of a *full* Docker setup: a container for PHP,
a container for MySQL and another container for Nginx - all of which communicate
to each other. In that situation, you don't have *anything* installed on your
"local" machine except for Docker itself.

That "full Docker" setup is great - and, if you like it, awesome. But it also
adds complexity: sharing source code with the containers can make your app *super*
slow - especially on a Mac - and if you need to run a `bin/console` command, you
need to execute that from *within* a Docker container.

## Our Simple Docker Plan

And so, instead, we're going to do something *much* simpler. First, we *are* going
to have PHP installed on our local machine - I *do* have PHP installed on my Mac.
Then, we're *just* going to use Docker to launch *services* like MySQL, Redis
or Elasticsearch. Finally, we'll configure our local PHP app to communicate with
those containers.

For me, it's kind of the best of both worlds: it makes it super easy to launch
services like MySQL... but without the complexity that often comes with Docker.

## Hello make:docker:database

Ok, ready? To manage our Docker containers, we need to create a
`docker-compose.yaml` file that describes what we need.

***TIP
If you're using the latest version of Symfony Flex, then when you
ran `composer require orm`, it asked you if you wanted Docker
configuration. If you answered yes, congrats! You can skip this
step because you already have a `docker-compose.yml` file with
a `database` service inside. Skip ahead to around 4:30 when we
run `docker-compose up`.
***

That file is pretty simple but... let's cheat! Find your terminal and run:

```terminal
php bin/console make:docker:database
```

This command comes from MakerBundle version 1.20... and I *love* it. A big thanks
to community member
[Jesse Rushlow](https://github.com/jrushlow) for contributing this!

Ok: it doesn't see a `docker-compose.yaml` file, so it's going to create a new
one. I'll use MySQL and, for the version - I'll use `latest` - we'll talk more
about that in a few minutes.

And... done! The database service is ready!

Well, in reality, the *only* thing this command did was create a `docker-compose.yaml`
file: it didn't communicate with Docker or start any containers - it *just*
created this new `docker-compose.yaml` file.

[[[ code('57e47f9c54') ]]]

And... it's pretty basic: we have a service called `database` - that's just an
internal name for it - which uses a `mysql` image at its `latest` version. And
we're setting an environment variable in the container that makes sure the root
user password is... `password`! At the bottom, the `ports` config means that port
3306 of the container will be exposed to our *host* machine.

That last part is important: this will make it possible for our PHP code to talk
*directly* to MySQL in that container. This syntax actually means that port 3306
of the container will be exposed to a *random* port on our host machine. Don't
worry: I'll show you exactly what that means.

## docker-compose up

So... yay! We have a `docker-compose.yaml` file! To start *all* of the containers
that are described in it... which is just one - run:

```terminal
docker-compose up -d
```

***TIP
In newer versions of Docker (v2 and up), `compose` is a sub-command of docker itself,
so use `docker compose` instead of `docker-compose`.
***

The `-d` means "run as a daemon" - it runs in the background instead of holding
onto my terminal.

The first time you run this it will take a bit longer because it needs to download
MySQL. But eventually.... yes! With one command, we now have a database running
in the background!

So... how do we communicate with it? Next, let's learn a bit more about `docker-compose`
including how to connect to the MySQL instance *and* shut down the container.
