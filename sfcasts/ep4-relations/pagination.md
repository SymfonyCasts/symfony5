# Pagination with Pagerfanta

I want to add *one* more Doctrine-specific feature to our site: pagination.

Right now, on the homepage, we're rendering *every* question on the site. That's...
not very realistic. Instead, let's render 5 on each page with pagination links.

## KnpPaginator and Pagerfanta

Doctrine *does* come with tools for pagination... but they're a little "low level".
Fortunately, the Symfony ecosystem has two libraries that build on *top* of
Doctrine's tools to make pagination a pleasure. They're called KnpPaginator and
Pagerfanta.

Both of these are really good... and I have a hard time choosing between them.
In our Symfony 4 Doctrine tutorial, we talked about KnpPaginator. So in *this*
tutorial, let's explore Pagerfanta.

## Installing PagerfantaBundle

Search for "pagerfanta bundle" to find a GitHub page under the "BabDev" organization.
Scroll down a little and click into the documentation.

The PagerfantaBundle is a wrapper around a Pagerfanta *library* that holds most
of the functionality. So the documentation is kind of split between the bundle and
the library. Open the docs for the library in another tab so we have it handy...
then come back and click "Installation".

Copy the "composer require" line, spin over to your terminal and get it:


```terminal
composer require "babdev/pagerfanta-bundle:^3.6"
```

Let's see what that did:

```terminal
git status
```

Ok: nothing too interesting... though it *did* automatically enable the new bundle.

## Pagers Work with QueryBuilders

The controller for the homepage lives at `src/Controller/QuestionController.php`:
the `homepage` action. 

[[[ code('00bb3ffb45') ]]]

We're calling this custom repository method, which returns an array of `Question` objects.

[[[ code('c6b3c88f3f') ]]]

The biggest difference when using a paginator is that *we* will no longer execute
the query directly. Instead, our job will be to create a `QueryBuilder` and pass
*that* to the paginator... which will then figure out which page we're on, set
up the limit and offset parts of the query, and *then* execute it.

In other words, to prep for Pagerfanta, instead of returning an array of `Question`
objects, we need to return a `QueryBuilder`. Rename the method to
`createAskedOrderedByNewestQueryBuilder()` - good luck thinking of a longer name
than that - and it will return a `QueryBuilder`. 

[[[ code('6c3e33f02c') ]]]

Inside, all we need to do is remove `getQuery()` and `getResult()`.

[[[ code('6b122e3d7e') ]]]

Back over in the controller, change this to `$queryBuilder` equals
`$repository->createAskedOrderedByNewestQueryBuilder()`.

[[[ code('c1f5b0a40c') ]]]

We're ready!

## Installing the ORM Pagerfanta Adapter

The next step is to create a `Pagerfanta` object... you can see how in the "Rendering
Pagerfantas" section. This looks simple enough: create a new `Pagerfanta` and,
because we're using Doctrine, create a new `QueryAdapter` and pass in our
`$queryBuilder`.

Cool: `$pagerfanta = new Pagerfanta()`... and `new QueryAdapter()`... huh.
PhpStorm isn't finding that class!

This is a... kind of weird... but also really cool thing about the Pagerfanta
packages. Go back to library's documentation and click "Pagination Adapters".
The Pagerfanta library can be used to paginate a *lot* of different things.
Actually, click "Available Adapters".

For example, you can use Pagerfanta to paginate a relationship property - like
`$question->getAnswers()` - via its `CollectionAdapter`. Or you can use it to paginate
Doctrine DBAL queries... which is a lower-level way to use Doctrine. You can
also paginate MongoDB or, if you're using the Doctrine ORM like we are, you
can paginate with the `QueryAdapter`.

This is cool! But each adapter lives in its own Composer *package*... which is
why we don't have the `QueryAdapter` class yet. So let's install it: copy the
package name, spin over to your terminal, and run:

```terminal
composer require pagerfanta/doctrine-orm-adapter
```

Once PhpStorm indexes the new code... try `new QueryAdapter()` again. We have it!
Pass this `$queryBuilder`. We can also configure a few things, like
`->setMaxPerPage(5)`. I'm using 5 per page so that pagination is *really* obvious.

[[[ code('5bb9f5f679') ]]]

## Looping Over a Pagerfanta

For the template, instead of passing a `questions` variable, we're going to pass
a `pager` variable set to the `$pagerfanta` object.

[[[ code('004867e203') ]]]

Now, pop into the homepage template... and scroll up. We *were* looping over the
`questions` array. 

[[[ code('62eae0dcb3') ]]]

What do we do now? Loop over `pager`: `for question in pager`.

[[[ code('266770acaa') ]]]

Yup, we can treat the `Pagerfanta` object like an *array*. The *moment* that we
loop, Pagerfanta will execute the query it needs to get the results for the current
page.

Testing time! Go back to the homepage. If we refresh now... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Yes!
The paginator is limiting the results!

And check out the query for this page. Remember, the original query - before we
added pagination - was *already* pretty complex. The pager *wrapped* that query
in *another* query to get *just* the 5 question ids needed, ordered in the right
way. Then, with a second query, it grabbed the *data* for those 5 questions.

The point is: the pager does some heavy lifting to make this work... and our complex
query *doesn't* cause any issues.

So... cool! It returned only the first 5 results! But what about pagination links?
Like a link to get to the next page... or the last page? Let's handle that next.
